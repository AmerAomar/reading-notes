**What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.**

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular Python libraries used for data visualization. While they all serve the purpose of creating visual representations of data, they have different features and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

Matplotlib:

Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a wide range of customizable options for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
It offers low-level control over plot elements, allowing you to create highly customized visualizations.
Matplotlib is often used for creating basic plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.
It is a fundamental library for data visualization and serves as the foundation for other libraries like Seaborn and Pandas.
Matplotlib can be used for both simple and complex visualizations, making it suitable for a variety of use cases.
Example: A line plot showing the trend of stock prices over time would be a suitable visualization to create using Matplotlib.

Seaborn:

Seaborn is a higher-level statistical plotting library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a more user-friendly interface for creating aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
It offers a set of built-in themes and color palettes, making it easy to create visually appealing plots with minimal effort.
Seaborn focuses on statistical visualization and provides advanced statistical functions to enhance the understanding of data.
It excels at creating complex statistical visualizations such as distribution plots, regression plots, categorical plots, and correlation matrices.
Seaborn is commonly used for exploratory data analysis and data-driven storytelling.
Example: A box plot comparing the distribution of salaries across different job positions would be a suitable visualization to create using Seaborn.

Bokeh:

Bokeh is a library that specializes in interactive and web-based visualizations. It targets modern web browsers and allows for the creation of interactive dashboards, tools, and applications.
Bokeh generates visualizations using JavaScript, which enables the creation of interactive plots that respond to user interactions.
It supports a wide range of interactive features like zooming, panning, hovering, and selecting data points.
Bokeh is well-suited for building interactive data visualizations for web applications and creating interactive dashboards.
It can handle large datasets efficiently and allows for real-time streaming and updating of plots.
Example: An interactive scatter plot that displays additional information when the user hovers over a data point, such as the country name and its corresponding GDP, would be a suitable visualization to create using Bokeh.

## Seaborn Tutorial [link](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)

**In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.**

In Seaborn, there are several main functions to create different types of plots:

Relational Plots:

Function: sns.relplot()
Purpose: Relational plots are used to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables. They help to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Example Use Case: Creating a scatter plot to analyze the correlation between a student's study hours and their exam scores.
Categorical Plots:

Functions: Various functions such as sns.catplot(), sns.boxplot(), sns.barplot(), sns.countplot(), etc.
Purpose: Categorical plots are used to visualize the distribution and relationship between categorical variables. They provide insights into the distribution of categories, comparisons between groups, and statistical summaries.
Example Use Case: Creating a bar plot to compare the average sales of different products across multiple regions.
Distribution Plots:

Functions: Various functions such as sns.histplot(), sns.kdeplot(), sns.rugplot(), etc.
Purpose: Distribution plots are used to visualize the distribution and characteristics of a single variable. They help understand the central tendency, spread, and shape of the data distribution.
Example Use Case: Creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of students' ages in a class.

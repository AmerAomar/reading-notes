## Read & Write Files in Python
### Using the with statement to open and close files in Python helps prevent bugs and manage system resources efficiently. It is an essential skill for any programmer who works with file I/O.

### ***What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?***


### The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite (block of code) is finished, even if an exception is raised while the file is being operated upon. It helps manage resources and avoids the need to explicitly call the close() method on the file object.

## Reading and Writing Files in Python

### Learning how to read and write files in Python is a fundamental skill for any programmer, as it is a common task in many real-world applications. It allows you to store and retrieve data from files, which can be useful for data processing, data analysis, and web development, among other things. Additionally, learning how to use the 'with' statement and how to properly manage file resources can help prevent bugs and make your code more efficient and secure.

### ***Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.***

In Python, the read() method returns the entire contents of a file as a single string, while the readline() method reads one line of the file at a time. The read() method is useful when you want to read the entire file at once and manipulate the data as a string. The readline() method is useful when you want to read a file line by line, such as when you are processing a large file and don't want to load the entire file into memory at once.
### ex:
the read() method when you want to read the entire contents of a file into memory as a single string or bytes object. This can be useful when dealing with small files or when you need to manipulate the entire contents of a file at once.

the readline() method when you want to read a file line-by-line or when you only need to process a portion of a large file at a time. This method is useful when dealing with large files that may not fit entirely into memory.

## Recursion
### Learning about exception handling is important for writing robust code that can handle unexpected errors or input. It can help prevent program crashes and improve user experience by providing useful error messages. It also allows for better control flow of the program and can help with debugging.

### ***Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.***

Exception handling is a way to handle errors that occur during program execution. The 'try' block is used to enclose code that might cause an error, while the 'except' block handles the error if it occurs. The 'finally' block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This ensures proper execution of code and prevents program crashes. For example, if you try to open a file that doesn't exist, you can use exception handling to display an error message instead of crashing the program.
### ex:
if a program attempts to divide a number by zero, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError. We can use exception handling to catch this error and handle it gracefully

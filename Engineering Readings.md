### ***What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?***
Becoming a better problem solver in programming requires breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems, understanding the problem by reading it thoroughly, solving it manually, and optimizing the steps before writing any code. It's important not to be afraid of failure and to focus on the end goal, trying different solutions until success is achieved.

To do this effectively, read the problem twice to fully understand it, break it into smaller parts, solve it manually with sample data, optimize the steps, write the steps as comments or pseudo-code, and finally replace them with real code. If you get stuck, use debugging techniques and reassess the code optimization. With practice, these steps will become second nature and you'll be able to solve problems more efficiently.

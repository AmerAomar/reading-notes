### ***What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?****

When deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem, one of the more important things to consider is the time and space complexity of the operations that will be performed on the data structure.

### ***How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?***
To avoid infinite recursion, use a base case, tail recursion, iteration, or a stack data structure to manage the function state.

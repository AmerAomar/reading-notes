# Read: 29 -  Django Custom User

## What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

[Custom User Model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)

Flexibility: With a Custom User Model, you have more control over the structure and fields of the user model. You can tailor it to fit your specific application's needs. This allows you to add or remove fields, modify field types, and create relationships according to your requirements.

Scalability: The Custom User Model provides scalability by allowing you to add new fields to the user model without requiring additional database migrations. This is particularly useful when you anticipate the need for additional user-related data in the future.

Authentication: Custom User Model allows you to use alternative forms of authentication beyond the traditional username and password combination. You can implement authentication using email addresses, phone numbers, or any other unique identifier based on your application's authentication requirements.

Easy integration with third-party packages: Many Django packages and libraries expect the use of a custom user model. By using a Custom User Model from the beginning, you can seamlessly integrate various third-party packages, such as social authentication or user management tools.

Consistency across applications: If you are building multiple Django applications or microservices, having a consistent user model across all of them can be beneficial. A Custom User Model allows you to create a unified user model that can be used across all your projects, maintaining consistency in how user-related functionality is handled.

Future-proofing: By using a Custom User Model, you can future-proof your application in case you need to make changes to the user model as your project evolves. With the default User Model, making changes to the model after users have already been created can be complex and require data migrations.

## Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields

[Custom User Model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)

1. Start a new Django project or navigate to an existing project where you want to implement the Custom User Model.

2. Create a new Django app that will handle user-related functionality. You can use the following command in your project directory to create the app:

   ```py
   python manage.py startapp accounts
   ```

3. Open the `models.py` file within the newly created app (`accounts/models.py`), and define your Custom User Model class by subclassing `AbstractBaseUser` or `AbstractUser`. Here's an example of a simple Custom User Model with email-based authentication:

   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
   from django.db import models
   
   class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
       email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
       # Add any additional fields you require
   
       USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
       REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
   ```

   In this example, we've added an `email` field and set it as the `USERNAME_FIELD` for authentication purposes. You can add any other fields you need in your user model.

4. Open the `settings.py` file in your project directory and make the following changes:
   - Locate the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting and update it to point to your Custom User Model:

```py
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'
```

- Add the app you created in step 2 (`accounts`) to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
         ...
         'accounts',
         ...
     ]
```

5.Create the necessary database migrations for your Custom User Model using the following command:

```py
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
```

6.Apply the database migrations by running the following command:

```py

 python manage.py migrate

```

   This will create the required tables in your database for the Custom User Model.

7.Update any code that references the default user model (`django.contrib.auth.models.User`) to use your Custom User Model (`accounts.CustomUser`). This includes views, forms, serializers, and any other parts of your application that interact with the user model.

Once these steps are completed, you have successfully created and implemented a Custom User Model in Django. You can now use your Custom User Model for user authentication and access the additional fields you defined in the model.

## What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.

[django x](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox)

DjangoX is a project template and collection of Django apps that extend the functionality of Django and provide additional features commonly needed in web development projects. It aims to simplify and accelerate the process of building Django applications by including various pre-configured components and tools.

DjangoX complements Django by offering the following features:

1. Authentication: DjangoX includes a pre-built authentication system with user registration, login, password reset, and account activation functionality. It provides the necessary views, forms, and templates for handling user authentication, making it easy to incorporate authentication into your Django project.

2. User Profiles: The project template includes user profile functionality, allowing you to store additional information about users beyond the built-in fields provided by Django's default user model. This can be useful when you need to capture user-specific data or extend the user model with custom fields.

3. Static File Management: DjangoX provides a static file management setup that allows you to easily organize and serve static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. It includes configurations for static file storage, handling, and serving, making it straightforward to manage and serve static files in your project.

4. Administration Interface: The project template includes an enhanced administration interface with a modern and responsive design. It improves the visual appearance and usability of the Django admin, making it more user-friendly and intuitive.

5. Bootstrap Integration: DjangoX integrates Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, allowing you to leverage its pre-designed components and styles in your Django project. This enables you to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces with ease.

Example use case:
Let's say you are starting a new web application that requires user authentication, user profiles, and an administration interface. You also want to use Bootstrap to enhance the UI. In this case, incorporating DjangoX into your project can save you time and effort. You can use the project template as a starting point, which already includes the necessary configurations, views, templates, and styles to handle authentication, user profiles, and an improved administration interface. By using DjangoX, you can jumpstart your project and focus more on building the specific features of your application rather than spending time on repetitive setup tasks.

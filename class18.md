## Ceasar Cipher [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

**What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?**

The basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher is the substitution of letters in a message with other letters that are a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It is a simple form of substitution cipher, named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it for secure communication.

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext (the original message) a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. When reaching the end of the alphabet, the counting wraps around to the beginning. So, if the shift is 3, 'X' would become 'A', 'Y' would become 'B', and 'Z' would become 'C'.

To decrypt a message encoded with the Caesar Cipher, one simply needs to shift the letters in the opposite direction. If the original shift was 3, then shifting each letter 3 positions backward will reveal the plaintext.

Historically, the Caesar Cipher was used by Julius Caesar to protect sensitive military messages during his campaigns. It provided a simple way to encode messages and maintain secrecy, as long as the recipient knew the shift value. However, the Caesar Cipher is relatively easy to break through brute force or by analyzing the frequency distribution of letters in the ciphertext. Consequently, it is considered a weak encryption method by modern standards and is more commonly used as a learning tool to understand the principles of cryptography.

**What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?**

Symmetric encryption uses one shared key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Symmetric encryption is faster and efficient for securing large amounts of data, while asymmetric encryption is used for secure communication, key exchange, digital signatures, and email encryption.

Asymmetric encryption eliminates the need for sharing secret keys, establishes secure communication channels, and ensures message integrity and sender authenticity.

## How Computers Generate Random Numbers [link](https://www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/)

**How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography?**

Computers generate random numbers using two main methods: true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG). Here's an explanation of each and their use cases in cryptography:

True Random Number Generation (TRNG):
TRNG relies on unpredictable physical processes to generate random numbers. It uses various sources, such as atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or mouse movements, to gather random data. These sources are considered to be inherently unpredictable in nature. TRNG provides "true" randomness as the generated numbers are not predictable and have no discernible pattern.

Use Cases in Cryptography: TRNG is particularly useful in cryptographic applications that require high-security levels. It is used for generating cryptographic keys, initialization vectors, and nonces in encryption systems. TRNG ensures that the generated keys are truly random, making it extremely difficult for an attacker to guess or reproduce them.

Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG):
PRNG algorithms use deterministic processes to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random but are actually determined by an initial value called a seed. Once the seed is known, the sequence of numbers can be reproduced. PRNGs use mathematical algorithms to generate long sequences of numbers based on the seed value.

Use Cases in Cryptography: PRNGs are commonly used in various cryptographic applications. They are used for generating encryption keys, creating random challenges in protocols, and simulating random events. PRNGs are computationally efficient and provide a good approximation of randomness, making them suitable for most cryptographic scenarios where true randomness is not essential.

However, it's important to note that the seed value in PRNGs should be kept secret and unpredictable to ensure the security of cryptographic systems. If an attacker can predict or guess the seed, they may be able to reproduce the entire sequence of random numbers and compromise the security of the cryptographic algorithms.

In some cases, a combination of TRNG and PRNG is used to enhance the security of cryptographic systems. The TRNG is used to generate a random seed for the PRNG, ensuring a more unpredictable starting point for generating pseudo-random numbers.

Overall, TRNG provides true randomness based on physical processes, while PRNG generates random-like numbers based on deterministic algorithms. The choice between TRNG and PRNG depends on the specific security requirements of the cryptographic application and the level of randomness needed for the generated numbers.

## What’s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy. [link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking)

**What’s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.**

Encryption and decryption are two fundamental processes in cryptography that are used to protect the confidentiality of data. Here's an analogy to explain the difference:

Imagine you have a lockbox containing a secret message. Encryption is like locking the box with a padlock, while decryption is like unlocking the box to reveal the message inside.

Encryption:
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (the original message) into ciphertext (the encrypted message) using an encryption algorithm and a secret key. It scrambles the data in such a way that it becomes unintelligible and unreadable to unauthorized individuals. It's similar to putting the secret message inside the lockbox and securing it with a padlock. The encryption algorithm and key determine how the plaintext is transformed into ciphertext, providing the necessary security.

Decryption:
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It involves converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and the corresponding secret key. It's like unlocking the padlock on the lockbox to retrieve the original secret message. Decryption restores the encrypted data to its original form, making it readable and understandable again.

In the analogy, the lockbox represents the encrypted message (ciphertext), and the padlock represents the encryption key. The act of locking the box corresponds to encryption, while unlocking it corresponds to decryption. Only someone with the correct key can unlock the box and access the original message.

The purpose of encryption and decryption is to ensure that sensitive information remains confidential and secure during transmission or storage. It provides a means of protecting data from unauthorized access and maintaining the privacy of communications.
